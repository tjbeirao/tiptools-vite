  <li><b>Respect</b> – We believe in mutual respect in all aspects of the human being. By teaching respect to children, we can help them develop into empathetic behaviour, and create a compassionate and understanding community.</li>
  <li><b>Community</b> – We approach sense of community involving our children, parents, caregivers, and neighbours in our activities and events. By working together and supporting one another, we can create a stronger community that fosters a sense of belonging.</li>
  <li><b>Creativity</b> – We are committed to providing freedom of exploration. By providing opportunities for children to explore and create in various forms, they can unlock new ways of thinking and problem-solving.</li>
  <li><b>Curiosity</b> – We strive curiosity by provoking questions in the children’s daily experiences. By embracing and encouraging curiosity, children can elaborate questions, seek answers, and try new things that will help them expand their world.</li>`
